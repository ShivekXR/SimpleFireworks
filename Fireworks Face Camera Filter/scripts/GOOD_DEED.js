GOOD DEED TERMS     https://ShivekXR.com/GoodDeed/

Reselling the project files (original, parts, modified, as a
binary file, compiled, etc.) is prohibited unless three
conditions are met:

1. You, as the seller, like dogs.

2. You sell just the project for more than 100$ in one
transaction. Yes, 100USD - one hundred United States Dollars.

3. You donate at least 10% of the transaction's price to your
local or the closest animal charity or animal non-profit
organization. Try to find the one that helps dogs. If you
can't, then please donate an animal shelter.

[note from the author] Shivek: The New Year is coming and some of
our lovely smaller friends might be frightened of the fireworks
explosions. I wonder and hope that all the New Year filters we
create will somehow reduce the noise pollution in the upcomming
days. Happy New Year my dudes!

You have to keep this text file <GOOD_DEED.js> unmodified
in the project.
